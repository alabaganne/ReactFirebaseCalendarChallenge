# React Calendar with Firebase as a Backend

This project is a part of challenge in order to join a company called "Sastec group". For this challenge, I had to learn React, Firebase firestore and develop this project in 3 days.

## Work done

- Transforming an image into a web page (not completed)
- Adding events to the calendar
- Deleting events

## Technologies

- React.js
- Firebase
- SCSS

## Bugs

- the `handleDeleteEvent()` on the `Event.js` file is fired when the component mounts and I couldn't figure out why.

## Installation

After cloning the project and moving to its directory, run the following commands:

### `npm i`

### `npm start`
