# React Calendar with Firebase as a Backend

## Work done

- Transforming an image into a web page (not completed)
- Adding events to the calendar
- Deleting events

## Technologies

- React.js
- Firebase
- SCSS

## Bugs

- the `handleDeleteEvent()` on the `Event.js` file is fired when the component mounts and I couldn't figure out why.

## Installation

After cloning the project and moving to its directory, run the following commands:

### `npm i`

### `npm start`
