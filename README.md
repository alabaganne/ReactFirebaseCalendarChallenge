# React Calendar with Firebase as a Backend
This project is a part of a test to join "Sastec group" as a Full-stack web developer. I had to learn React, Firebase firestore and develop this app in 3 days.

### Work done
- Transforming an image into a web page (not completed)
- Adding events to the calendar
- Deleting events

### Technologies
- React.js
- Firebase
- SCSS

### Bugs
- the `handleDeleteEvent()` on the `Event.js` file for some unknown reason is called automatically when the component mounts.

### Installation
After cloning the project and moving to its directory, run this command `npm install && npm start`
